## 🕯️ About the Game

**The Sluagh’s Sacrifice** is a **found-footage horror experience** set in **rural Ireland**, inspired by folklore, myth, and the chilling quiet of the Irish countryside.

You are given access to **classified recovered footage** discovered near a bog — believed to be tied to a string of unexplained disappearances across the country.  
The tapes appear to have been filmed in what’s come to be known as *“The Most Haunted House in Ireland.”*

A group of students attempted to document the house after being given its keys by an **unknown figure**.  
They were **never heard from again**.

Your mission: **examine the footage and uncover the truth**.  
Because something isn’t right — and it’s not just the house.

> 🎞️ *What happened in that house?*  
> 🕯️ *Why did they vanish?*  
> ☘️ *And what, exactly, is The Sluagh?*
